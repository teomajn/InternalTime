As a composer, I view my work as the process of creating relationships in time,
however, in this project, those relationships are difficult to craft as the individual
parts that constitute them are subjected to their own performative processes. 
The instant of orchestrational simultaneity, which, in live performance, is 
rendered as a window of time varying in width from the imperceptible to the unacceptable,
is here magnified to the scale of musical structure.


The orchestration of simultaneity is an impossibility in this project
